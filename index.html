  <b>Unit Summaries</b><!-- Summing up what each unit is abouit-->
  <div class="wave" id="u1">
    <b>Unit 1</b>
    <p>	Unit 1 was the basics to what design and development will be about. Here we are taught the things that we will use for the rest of the year, HTML. HTML is a coding language that is used by computers to be able to create web pages and websites. We are taught how to start the page with headings and other things to enhance our websiteâ€™s ability to display information. Adding pictures, links and paragraphs. We also use CSS to help design and shape our website to make it look good to look at. We are also taught how to use binary code and why it is important for coding. Computers can only compute 2 characters which are 0 and 1. Using this at a bigger scale helps a computer to store information. Lastly we learn about digital and analog data that is used for pictures. analog  pictures are for stuff you see in real life such as paintings. Digital is a representation of analog data on a computer screen (pixels). Digital data can be very detailed or not detailed at all to be able to save data.</p>

    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <p>	In this unit we learned about how the internet works and how we play into it. Computing networks are devices that are interconnected with one another and made so they can receive and send data to one another. Computers can send and receive data by paths which are connections between computers. Paths and computers have bandwidths which is the max amount of data that a computer can send at once. The internet has protocols which are rules set by computers on how they can send data which is from your IP address. Computers have 2 ways of sending data, UDP and TCP. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is something that will send the data very fast but will not double check to see that all data is sent. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is slower than UDP but is a lot more reliable in making sure everything is sent to the correct location. Data is sent in things called packets when they are larger.</p>

    <b>Unit 3</b>
    <p>	Unit 3 is based on the creation of apps. In apps we use everyday there is input and output, input is what you do to the app that gives it information and output is what the computer will show you based on what you put into it. We send information to the computer by a user interface which can let you type, click, shake, and do something to send information. We learn about how specific we need to be for the computer to understand the instructions that we give it. There are 2 ways we can give instructions. Sequential is when the computer reads the code from the beginning to end without any sort of user input. Event driven programming is when the computer gives output based on the user using the app and needing to give some sort of input. Program statements are used to tell the computer what to do. In coding like this bugs are very common so you can do pair programming with another person to check over your work and you can check over theirs.</p>

  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <p>	In this unit we learn how to create apps and use a coding language called JavaScript. We first start learning pseudocode which is plain language used to tell a computer what to do. We use things called functions and call them to be able to write something down once and be able to call that code at later times. We use conditional statements to be able to decide if something should happen or not. We can use Boolean statements to give us a true or false answer based on comparison operators. We learn how to start off javascript with creating variables and calling them at later times. We see that we can use onEvents to be able to create user inputs and then use that to try and get the computer to change something and then give an output. In our code it can become very repetitive and we can do something called functions which is where you can write down the code in one place at once and call the function name. At times you need to write all of the code so you can save memory and time.
