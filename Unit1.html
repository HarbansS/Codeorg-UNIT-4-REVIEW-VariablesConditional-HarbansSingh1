    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b>
    <p>I feel the best strategies to learn the best is to take good notes. Taking bad notes will not help you when you are looking for something or don't understand how to. They are similar to other students since they can help with memorization and so they understand the material fully</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="l1"><!--l1 is used -->
    <b>Lesson 2: Representing Information</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b><!--question-->
    <p>We did it as 2 options as a way to show how many patterns and ways there are to find it instead of just adding more and more stuff</p><!--answer-->
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</b>
    <p>I would explain it as a system where we use symbols in different sequences to represent the amount of something.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 4: Binary Number</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</b>
    <p>Similarities between both systems are that they can both be used by computers to find value and a difference is that binary is 2 digit and decimal is 10 digit</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</b>
    <p>You can represent fractions with bits since there can be as many bits as you want there to be.</p>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 6: Representing Text</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>Multiple Representation: "The binary pattern 010000001 represents the number 65." Write a brief response explaning whether yyou believe this statement is always true. Explain your reasoning.</b>
    <p>No, 1 and 0 need to be assigned in different locations to represent 65, it shows 129 as the 1 is one behind.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 7: Black and White Images</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image?</b>
    <p>Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 8: Color Images</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</b>
    <p>Sampling is when you take a picture and try to recreate it on a digital computer. You have to put in each color and plot them all in the correct spaces, if you have more places to sample then it will take longer but you will get a better result but if you have less spots to fill in it will be faster but it won't look as good depending on the analog data</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 9: Lossless Compression</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.

    If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b>
    <p>I would say that your computer is trying to make your file smaller so it uses less data and is easier to send, you should not worry since the data that you sent is still there and when it is sent to the person you emailed it to they will be able to make it 1000 bytes again</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b>
    <p>The best things that can use lossless compression are videos and music and lossy compression can be texting and sending images.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 11: Intellectual Property</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:

    Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.

    Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</b>
    <p>We would need to copyright the image so that we can make sure others have to either credit or give us some money for using our design.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Q & A -->
    <div class="wave" id="l1">
    <b>Lesson 12: Project Digital Information Dilemmasz</b>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</b>
    <p>We should care about information being represented digitally since the future is a lot more connected to the internet compared to previous generations. It will impact me personally because I am going to be using the internet as I grow up and need to rely on it at times.</p>
